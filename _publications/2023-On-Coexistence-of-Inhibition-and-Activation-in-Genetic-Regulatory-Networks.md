excerpt: 'Dynamical mathematical models of Genomic Regulatory Networks are considered. We focus on attractors in these models, which has the form of a periodic trajectory. Our observations show that closed orbits can exist in phase spaces of a three-dimensional network with the regulatory matrices, where inhibitory cycle coexists with the activatory one. Examples, illustrations and results of numerical experiments are provided.'
